# Modern JavaScript Basics

Update: Course Completed as of January 31, 2023

This repository was used to follow the course provided by Laracasts:

[Modern JavaScript Basics](https://laracasts.com/series/modern-javascript-basics)

My goal is to get a refresher on modern JavaScript, kind of as a prerequisite for VueJS.

This repo will also include:
- ~~Assignments (if the course provides it)~~
- JS files created for each lesson.
- Wiki, which includes notes/reviews of what I've learned. (WIP)

## How to Run
Since I also have PHP installed locally, I run this command:
```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```
And then open `localhost:8000`.
