# Modern JavaScript Basics

Using this repository to follow along the course provided by Laracasts:

[Modern JavaScript Basics](https://laracasts.com/series/modern-javascript-basics)

My goal is to get a refresher on modern JavaScript, kind of as a prerequisite for VueJS.

# How to Run
Since I also have PHP installed locally, I run this command:
```
run php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```
And then open `localhost:8000`.
