# Modern JavaScript Basics

Using this repository to follow the course provided by Laracasts:

[Modern JavaScript Basics](https://laracasts.com/series/modern-javascript-basics)

My goal is to get a refresher on modern JavaScript, kind of as a prerequisite for VueJS.

This repo will also include:
- Assignments (if the course provides it)
- Wiki, which includes notes/reviews of what I've learned.

## How to Run
Since I also have PHP installed locally, I run this command:
```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```
And then open `localhost:8000`.
